        <h1>SECURITY</h1>
        <p>The E-Portal of Case Management offers a comprehensive solution to address the challenges of pending cases in
            Indian courts. With increased efficiency and better case management, it aims to tackle the issue of over
            5.02 crore pending cases.
            Encryption: Implement robust encryption techniques to ensure that all data, both in transit and at rest, is securely encrypted. Utilize strong encryption algorithms such as AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with keys managed securely.

            Access Control: Implement granular access control mechanisms to restrict access to confidential documents based on user roles, permissions, and authentication factors. This includes techniques such as role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security.
            
            Data Loss Prevention (DLP): Utilize DLP tools and techniques to prevent the unauthorized sharing or leakage of sensitive data. This involves scanning documents for sensitive information and applying policies to prevent their unauthorized distribution.
            
            Audit Logging and Monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities to track user activities and detect any suspicious behavior. This includes monitoring access patterns, file modifications, and authentication attempts to identify potential security threats.
            
            Secure Transmission Protocols: Ensure that data is transferred securely over the network using protocols such as TLS (Transport Layer Security) to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
            
            Regular Security Audits and Assessments: Conduct regular security audits and assessments to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities or compliance gaps. This includes penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and compliance checks to ensure adherence to industry standards and regulations.
            
            Data Residency and Compliance: Offer options for users to choose the geographic location where their data will be stored to comply with data residency requirements and regulations. Ensure compliance with relevant data protection laws such as GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA.
            
            Backup and Disaster Recovery: Implement robust backup and disaster recovery solutions to ensure the availability and integrity of confidential documents in the event of data loss or system failures.
            
            User Education and Awareness: Provide comprehensive user education and training programs to raise awareness about best practices for securing confidential documents in the cloud. This includes training users on how to use encryption, access controls, and other security features effectively.
            
            Continuous Improvement and Updates: Commit to continuous improvement by regularly updating security measures and incorporating the latest security technologies and best practices to stay ahead of evolving threats.</p>
